**-WEEK 3 AND 4(Lecture 3&4)-**

•Collaborative Discussion 1- Digitalisation

•Cyber Kill Chain Model

-The model identifies what the adversaries must complete in order to achieve their objective.
The seven steps of the Cyber Kill Chain® enhance visibility into an attack and enrich an analyst’s understanding of an adversary’s tactics, techniques and procedures.

•Good Cyber Security practice

•Stride  and Dread  modelling

SEMINAR FOR SOLARWINDS ATTACK

•Create a table that analyses the solar winds exploit using the Cyber Kill Chain. Are there any phases that you cannot identify?

•Create a list of possible mitigations for each phase. Are there any phases you cannot mitigate?

•What tools would you utilise in each phase? Give reasons for your answer.

Simulating a DoS Attack

Simulating DoS attack In this lab, you will learn to simulate a DoS attack. A denial-of-service (DoS) attack is a cyber-attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet.

Setting up a Honeypot E-portfolio activity

Honey pot is a computer system that is set up to trap cyber attackers who try to gain unauthorised access to information systems.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**-WEEK 6 AND 7(Lecture 6)-**

We discussed in class about attacks on enterprise networks(Active & Passive attacks) and also the steps to make those attacks.

We learned and discussed about Man-in-the-middle attacks.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**-WEEK 8 AND 9(IoT Introduction)-**

**IoT And Physical Computing**

We made an introduction to IoT and Physical Computing.

Learned about IoT devices in human life and enabling technologies.

Talked about some IoT projects that can be in our lifes in future and the IoT projects that we used in present time in our lives.

**Selecting an IoT Infrastructure**

This is a small project about implementing IoT infrastructures into greenhouses.

**-WEEK 10 AND 11(IoT)-**

This week we continued the lecture IoT and we learned more about different IoT infastructures

Also we had a guest speaker Babak Reihani,Rehani has practical experience in design and construction of microcontroller boards and developing them in IoT and smart renewable energy . He is an expert in data analytics with python and modeler software. Also he has experience in designing solar power plants and a PV solar test Lab. He is the director of Smart Rasa Group.

He helps mission-driven organizations leverage the power of IoT and data analytics to maximize their impact. He takes pride in listening to customers' needs and crafting well-architected, innovative, and scalable IoT solutions that help his customers achieve their goals.

He is dedicated to engaging with IoT communities, educating, exciting, and inspiring them to build with and contribute to Smart systems

He made a presentation to us about the history of IoT and the core aspects of IoT.He talked about how IoT changed the world with technology and the importance of IoT in the future.


He also showed us some IoT devices such as smart camera,smart alarm system,motion sensoring device,heat meter etc. I really impressed about the things he explained and showed to us and I will definitely consider doing a career in IoT field.
