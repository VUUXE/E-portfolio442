-WEEK 3 AND 4(Lecture 3&4)-
•Collaborative Discussion 1- Digitalisation

•Cyber Kill Chain Model

-The model identifies what the adversaries must complete in order to achieve their objective.
The seven steps of the Cyber Kill Chain® enhance visibility into an attack and enrich an analyst’s understanding of an adversary’s tactics, techniques and procedures.

•Good Cyber Security practice

•Stride  and Dread  modelling

SEMINAR FOR SOLARWINDS ATTACK

•Create a table that analyses the solar winds exploit using the Cyber Kill Chain. Are there any phases that you cannot identify?
•Create a list of possible mitigations for each phase. Are there any phases you cannot mitigate?
•What tools would you utilise in each phase? Give reasons for your answer.
•Create a slide deck presentation with up to 4 slides that discuss your solution. Be prepared to present it at the seminar this week.

Simulating a DoS Attack

Simulating DoS attack In this lab, you will learn to simulate a DoS attack. A denial-of-service (DoS) attack is a cyber-attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet.

Setting up a Honeypot E-portfolio activity

Honey pot is a computer system that is set up to trap cyber attackers who try to gain unauthorised access to information systems.
